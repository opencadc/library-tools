# Library Tools

Library Tools are a community-facing workflow of best practices, recommendations and tooling that helps scientists and developers produce and discover high-quality containerized research software. It is designed for scientists first, while still supporting developers and power users who need stronger policy control and automation-friendly outputs.

## The Goal
Users should not need to independently master container hardening, reproducibility workflows, metadata standards, and dependency modernization just to publish reliable research software.

## What we strive to provide
- A manifest-driven contract.
- Opinionated defaults tools with configurable policy profiles.
- End-to-end CLI workflow from initialization to publishing of artifacts.
- Structured outputs suitable for local use and CI integration.
