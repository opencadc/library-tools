# Library Tools

Library Tools is a community-facing workflow, recommendations set, and CLI for producing high-quality containerized research software. It is designed for scientists first, while still supporting developers and power users who need stronger policy control and automation-friendly outputs.

The goal is simple: users should not need to independently master container hardening, reproducibility workflows, metadata standards, and dependency modernization just to publish reliable research software.

## What the tools provide

- A manifest-driven contract for build and metadata intent.
- Opinionated defaults with configurable policy profiles.
- End-to-end CLI workflow from initialization to publish artifacts.
- Structured outputs suitable for local use and CI integration.
